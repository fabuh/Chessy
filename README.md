# Chessy

Chessy is something that I had fun with back in early college days.
It was a chance to make something for myself and to practice a bit.
I left the project alone for a long time when I started working and now I decided to fix it up a bit.

The project is created with the following excercises in mind.
1) To use a simple array to work with something 2 dimentional.
2) To butt heads with the diamond problem at least once in my life.
	The queen in this game uses multiple inheritance of the Chess Piece based classes(Rook and Bishop).
3) To visualize something with simple usage of SDL.
4) To create clean and simple project generation with premake.
5) To try architecturing a software project on my own.
